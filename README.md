This project is a demonstration of an Express.js application, showcasing a basic structure with controllers, models, and routes. (MRC pattern, a variation of the more well known MVC patter)

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `index.js`: The main entry point of the application.
- `controllers/`: Contains the controller files managing the application's logic.
- `models/`: Contains the model files defining the data structures.
- `routes/`: Contains the route files handling the application's endpoints.
